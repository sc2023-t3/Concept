# YumPicker

YumPicker is a simple telegram bot to help you pick a restaurant to eat at. It uses the Google Map to find restaurants
near you
and then randomly picks one for you to eat at. It also allows you to filter by price, distance, and rating.

> 研究顯示，打字的時候不喜歡在中文和英文之間加空格的人，感情路都走得很辛苦，有七成的比例會在 34 歲的時候跟自己不愛的人結婚，而其餘三成的人最後只能把遺產留給自己的貓。畢竟愛情跟書寫都需要適時地留白。
> Research shows that people who don’t like to add spaces between Chinese and English when typing have a hard time in their relationship. Seventy percent of them will marry someone they don’t love at the age of 34, while the remaining 30% of people can only leave their inheritance to their cats. After all, both love and writing need to be left blank in a timely manner.
